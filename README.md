# PiCarD
_The Raspberry Pi portion of Flounder's Deathmobile / Starship Enterprise_

A combined effort from an audio/video engineer, a car enthusiast and personal 
fabrication wizard, some FOSS zealots, and two high school students learning
Python.

The plan is to take a very old, beat-up car, trick it out with all sorts of
new-ness and build in a touch-screen controlled Raspberry Pi combined media
center / motor control for windows, doors, seats, and sunroof. The windows
and sunroof will have monitors attached and pivot outward a la Doc Brown's
DeLorean.

Development will PROBABLY be with [Kivy Pie](http://kivypie.mitako.eu/) as
the base, since the project lead entertains fantasies of controlling it
remotely from a phone as well.
